# HydroLearn - Physical Hydrology JupyterHub Environment

This computing environment is built on Python version 3.8, specially designed
for the execution of computational jupyter notebooks related to the Physical
Hydrology course offered through HydroLearn. HydroLearn, an education project
funded by the National Science Foundation, aims to promote the collaborative
development and adoption of active learning resources in hydrology and water
resources engineering. Within this environment, you'll find TauDEM version
5.3.7, and a variety of pre-installed Python libraries including geopandas,
rasterio, rasterstats, osgeo, shapely, descartes, and fiona. These resources
collectively empower students to effectively engage in terrain analysis
exercises as part of the course curriculum.
